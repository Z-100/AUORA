# AUORA - An open source forum

## Description
AUORA is a 'high-level, high-quality, very-good, very-nice' REST-API built with lots of love <3

### What is AUORA?

Auora is an open source forum to discuss any topic in the form of a so-called "thread",
ask any questions to the community, and/or to comment answers or opinions beneath those
questions and threads. <br/>
And of course, the most important feature of any application, you can also up and/or down
vote any question, thread or comment!


Generally speaking it's the base of such a forum. In this repository you'll find anything 
related to the [design phase](https://github.com/z-100/AUORA/tree/master/other) and
[the code](https://github.com/z-100/AUORA). The entire project basically is a REST-API, which 
is expandable and easy to use:
* You can call it by simple POST/GET request via any browser
* It works with a small amount of parameters, of which most are used for authentication
    * Store once, use many times
* To add more features like topics or categories, just add more entities.
